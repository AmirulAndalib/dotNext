.NEXT
====

.NEXT (Dot Next) is a set of powerful libaries aimed to improve development productivity and extend .NET API with unique features which potentially will be implemented in the next versions of C# compiler or .NET Runtime. Wanted fast array or struct comparison, async delegate invocation, [Type Classes](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/issues/110), value type bitcast, metaprogramming, generic unsafe arrays? You're in right place.

1. Provide high-quality documentation
1. Stay cross-platform
1. Provide benchmarks
