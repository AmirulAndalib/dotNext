.NEXT
====

.NEXT (dotNext) is a set of powerful libaries aimed to improve development productivity and extend .NET API with unique features. Some of these features are planned in future releases of .NET platform but already implemented in the library:

| Proposal | Implementation |
| ---- | ---- |
| [Enum API](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/34077) | [Documentation](https://sakno.github.io/dotNext/features/core/enum.html)
| [Check if an instance of T is a default(T)](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/16209) | [IsDefault() method](https://sakno.github.io/dotNext/api/DotNext.ValueType-1.html#DotNext_ValueType_1_IsDefault__0_) |
| [Concept Types](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/issues/110) | [Documentation](https://sakno.github.io/dotNext/features/concept.html) |
| [Expression Trees covering additional language constructs](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/issues/158), i.e. `foreach`, `await`, patterns, multi-line lambda expressions | [Metaprogramming](https://sakno.github.io/dotNext/features/metaprogramming/index.html) |
| [Async Locks](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/34073) | [Documentation](https://sakno.github.io/dotNext/features/threading/index.html)

Quick overview of additional features:

* [Attachment of user data to arbitrary objects](https://sakno.github.io/dotNext/features/core/userdata.html)
* [Automatic generation of Equals/GetHashCode](https://sakno.github.io/dotNext/features/core/autoeh.html) for arbitrary type at runtime which is much better that Visual Studio compile-time helper for generating these methods
* Extended set of [atomic operations](https://sakno.github.io/dotNext/features/core/atomic.html). Inspired by [AtomicInteger](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/10/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/atomic/AtomicInteger.html) and friends from Java
* [Async execution of delegates](https://sakno.github.io/dotNext/features/core/asyncd.html) as replacement of `BeginInvoke` and `EndInvoke` pair of methods which are not supported in .NET Core.
* [Fast Reflection](https://sakno.github.io/dotNext/features/reflection/fast.html)
* `ManualResetEvent`, `ReaderWriterLockSlim` and other synchronization primitives now have their [asynchronous versions](https://sakno.github.io/dotNext/features/threading/rwlock.html)
* Powerful concurrent [ObjectPool](https://sakno.github.io/dotNext/features/threading/objectpool.html)
* ASP.NET Core [Clustered microservices](https://sakno.github.io/dotNext/features/cluster/aspnetcore.html) powered by Raft Consensus Algorithm, data replication and point-to-point messaging

All these things are implemented on top of existing .NET Standard stack without modifications of Roslyn compiler or CoreFX libraries.

**DISCLAIMER**: API is unstable prior to 1.0 version because the library is in active development. Backward compatibility is not guaranteed.

# Development Process
Philosophy of development process:
1. All libraries in .NEXT family based on .NET Standard to be available for wide range of .NET implementations: Mono, Xamarin, .NET Core
1. Minimize set of dependencies
1. Rely on .NET standard libraries
1. Provide high-quality documentation
1. Stay cross-platform
1. Provide benchmarks
