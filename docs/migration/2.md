Migration from 2.x
====
3.x is mostly compatible with 2.x. However, there are several minor and major incompatible changes in API surface.

# Incompatible Changes
## Value Delegates
Value Delegates now have native support of [function pointers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/csharp-9#performance-and-interop). This feature is available starting from C# 9. Thus, you cannot use value delegates to wrap the function pointer in C# 8 when targeting .NET Standard 2.1.

## Augmented Compilation
`DotNext.Augmentation.Fody` was introduced to obtain value delegates from function pointers in C# 8. Now it's not needed because C# 9 has syntax for function pointers.

## Write-Ahead Log
Some methods of `IAuditTrail<TEntry>` interface refactored to simplify their signature. For example, `ReadAsync` method now doesn't accept log entry consumer as a generic parameter.

## Obsolete Members and Classes
All obsolete members and classes in 2.x has been removed.

## ArrayRental&lt;T&gt;
`ArrayRental<T>` type has been replaced with `MemoryOwner<T>` type.
