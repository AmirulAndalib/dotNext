Migration from 1.x
====
2.x is mostly compatible with 1.x. However, there are several minor and major incompatible changes in API surface.

Minor changes:
1. `DotNext.IO` namespace and its classes moved from **DotNext** library to **DotNext.IO** library
1. Encoding and decoding context from `DotNext.Text` namespace moved to **DotNext.IO** library
1. `DotNext.Runtime.InteropServices.Memory` class merged with `DotNext.Runtime.Intrinsics`
1. Core interfaces from `DotNext.Net.Cluster.Replication` namespace moved to **DotNext.IO** library
1. `DotNext.Net.Cluster.Consensus.Raft.PersistentState` class from `DotNext.Net.Cluster` class now completely migrated to `ValueTask` instead of `Task`

Major changes:
1. **DotNext.AspNetCore.Cluster** now relies on .NET Core 3.1 SDK instead of .NET Standard 2.1. This was happened because ASP.NET Core 3.x dependencies are not available from NuGet and became a part of .NET Core SDK.
1. **DotNext.AspNetCore.Cluster** uses Generic Host Builder instead of Web Host Builder so configuration methods are changed. Examine [this](../features/cluster/aspnetcore.md) article for more info.
1. `DotNext.Runtime.InteropServices.UnmanagedMemory` and `DotNext.Runtime.InteropServices.UnmanagedMemory<T>` classes from **DotNext.Unsafe** library are no longer exist. Use [UnmanagedMemoryPool](../api/DotNext.Buffers.UnmanagedMemoryPool-1.yml) class instead.
